Happy Birthday: A simple Sinatra app for celebrating someone's birthday.

On the day of their birthday, the app will show a 'cryptic' form to all
visitors. Filling out the form provides a birthday-themed madlib featuring a
picture of the special guy/gal.

On all other days of the year, you get a JS countdown (powered by jQuery and
<http://plugins.jquery.com/project/countdown2>).

Try going to /birthday on a non-birthday date and get a special easter egg!

Customizing:

You can easily change this app to use a person other than Christian
Rodriguez (I don't know why you would want to, but I digress....)

Simply change three variables in the before filter in app.rb:

@person[:first] = 'Christian'
@person[:last] = 'Rodriguez'
@person[:birthday] = Date.commercial(2011, 21, 1) #see Date docs

Finally, update public/person.jpg with your new birthday boy/girl. That's it!
